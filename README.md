In this visualization, I explore the crisp map by mapping the Colombian population for 2023 using data from the [humanitarian data exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/kontur-population-colombia?). I use R with rayshader package and *Milos makes maps* tutorials. 

Here is the result. It is striking how the Colombian population is concentrated in some areas (mainly big cities in the mountains, some coastal cities and northern part of the country) compared tothe same map of population distribution in Germany for instance.
